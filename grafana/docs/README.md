## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Grafana 10.0+
- Loki datasource configured and accessible
- SLAM Poker application with enhanced logging enabled

### 1. Environment Configuration

Update your environment variables:

```bash
# Loki Configuration
LOKI_URL=http://your-loki-instance:3100
LOKI_ENABLED=true

# Alert Notification Channels
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_CRITICAL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/CRITICAL/WEBHOOK
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_WARNINGS=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WARNING/WEBHOOK
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_BUSINESS=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/BUSINESS/WEBHOOK
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_ENGINEERING=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/ENGINEERING/WEBHOOK
PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY=your-pagerduty-key
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-org.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/your-teams-webhook
DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-custom-webhook-endpoint.com/alerts
```

### 2. Grafana Configuration

#### Option A: Manual Import

1. Copy dashboard JSON files from `dashboards/` directory
2. Import each dashboard in Grafana UI (+ â†’ Import)
3. Configure datasource to point to your Loki instance
4. Set up notification channels in Alerting â†’ Contact Points
5. Import alerting rules from `alerting/rules.yml`

#### Option B: Provisioning (Recommended)

1. Copy provisioning files to your Grafana provisioning directory:

   ```bash
   cp provisioning/datasource.yml /etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources/
   cp provisioning/dashboard.yml /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/
   cp dashboards/*.json /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/
   cp alerting/rules.yml /etc/grafana/provisioning/alerting/
   cp alerting/notifications.yml /etc/grafana/provisioning/alerting/
   ```

2. Restart Grafana service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
   ```

### 3. Verification

1. **Datasource:** Verify Loki connection in Configuration â†’ Data Sources
2. **Dashboards:** Check all 6 dashboards load without errors
3. **Alerts:** Confirm alert rules are active in Alerting â†’ Alert Rules
4. **Notifications:** Test notification channels work correctly

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Usage Guide

### Template Variables

All dashboards include template variables for filtering:

- **Service:** Filter by service name (default: slam-poker)
- **Environment:** Filter by deployment environment (production, staging, etc.)
- **Time Range:** Adjust observation window
- **Custom Filters:** Dashboard-specific filters (room codes, correlation IDs, etc.)

### Key Features

- **Correlation ID Tracing:** Click correlation IDs to trace requests across logs
- **Drill-down Navigation:** Click metrics to explore related data
- **Alert Integration:** Visual indicators when alerts are firing
- **Auto-refresh:** Real-time data updates for operational monitoring

### Best Practices

- **System Health:** Monitor continuously during business hours
- **Error Analysis:** Check after deployments and during incidents
- **Business Intelligence:** Review weekly for trends and insights
- **Capacity Planning:** Monitor daily, plan monthly infrastructure changes

## ðŸ”§ Customization

### Adding New Panels

1. Create LogQL queries using the patterns in `queries.md`
2. Follow existing dashboard naming conventions
3. Include appropriate thresholds and alert conditions
4. Document new metrics in this README

### Modifying Alerts

1. Update `alerting/rules.yml` with new conditions
2. Test alert expressions using Grafana explore mode
3. Configure appropriate notification routing
4. Document alert purpose and response procedures

### Environment-Specific Tuning

- **Development:** Increase refresh rates, reduce alert sensitivity
- **Staging:** Mirror production settings for testing
- **Production:** Optimize for performance, strict alert thresholds

## ðŸ“‹ Maintenance Tasks

### Daily

- [ ] Check System Health dashboard for anomalies
- [ ] Review active alerts and resolve as needed
- [ ] Monitor capacity metrics for scaling needs

### Weekly

- [ ] Review Business Intelligence trends
- [ ] Update alert thresholds based on usage patterns
- [ ] Clean up resolved alert noise

### Monthly

- [ ] Analyze Error Analysis patterns for improvements
- [ ] Review Capacity Planning projections
- [ ] Update documentation for dashboard changes
- [ ] Performance tune queries for efficiency

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Data in Dashboards**

- Verify Loki datasource configuration
- Check SLAM Poker logging is enabled (`LOKI_ENABLED=true`)
- Confirm time range includes data periods
- Validate LogQL query syntax

**Alerts Not Firing**

- Check alert rule expressions in Grafana
- Verify notification channel configurations
- Test webhook endpoints and API keys
- Review alert evaluation frequency settings

**Poor Dashboard Performance**

- Optimize LogQL queries using indexes
- Reduce refresh rates during high load
- Implement query result caching
- Consider log retention policies

**Missing Metrics**

- Ensure application logging includes required metadata
- Check log ingestion pipeline for errors
- Verify Loki label extraction rules
- Review dashboard variable filters
