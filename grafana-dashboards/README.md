### 2. Room Analytics Dashboard (`slam-poker-room-analytics.json`)
**Room-specific metrics and user behavior**
- Peak users by room
- Votes cast per room
- Room lifecycle events (created, joined, left, voting started, votes revealed)
- Voting round duration analysis
- Total votes cast by room (table view)

**SLA monitoring and alerting**
- HTTP success rate (SLA: 99.9%)
- Average response time (SLA: <100ms)
- Error rate (SLA: <0.1%)
- Critical alert status
- Memory and CPU usage alerts
- WebSocket connection health
- Room capacity monitoring
- SLA compliance over time

## Prerequisites

1. **Prometheus**: Your application must be exposing metrics at `/metrics` endpoint
2. **Grafana**: Version 8.0+ recommended
3. **Prometheus Data Source**: Configure Grafana to connect to your Prometheus instance

## Importing Dashboards

### Method 1: Grafana UI
1. Open Grafana web interface
2. Navigate to **"+"** â†’ **"Import"**
3. Click **"Upload JSON file"** or paste the JSON content
4. Select your Prometheus data source
5. Click **"Import"**

### Method 2: Grafana API
```bash
# Example for Overview dashboard
curl -X POST \
  http://your-grafana-instance/api/dashboards/db \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @slam-poker-overview.json
```

### Method 3: Grafana CLI (if you have file access)
```bash
# Copy dashboards to Grafana provisioning directory
sudo cp *.json /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
```

## Prometheus Configuration

Ensure your `prometheus.yml` includes a scrape config for SLAM Poker:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'slam-poker'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3001']  # Your app's host:port
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    scrape_interval: 15s
```

## Key Metrics Tracked

### Gauges (Current State)
- `slam_poker_active_rooms` - Currently active rooms
- `slam_poker_active_users` - Currently active users
- `slam_poker_active_sessions` - Currently active sessions
- `slam_poker_system_health_score` - Overall system health (0-100)
- `slam_poker_peak_users_in_room{room_code}` - Peak users per room

### Counters (Totals)
- `slam_poker_rooms_created_total` - Total rooms created
- `slam_poker_user_joins_total` - Total user joins
- `slam_poker_votes_cast_total{room_code}` - Total votes cast
- `slam_poker_websocket_connections_total{event_type}` - WebSocket events
- `slam_poker_http_requests_total{method,path,status_code}` - HTTP requests
- `slam_poker_errors_total{error_category}` - Application errors

### Histograms (Distributions)
- `slam_poker_http_request_duration_seconds` - HTTP latency
- `slam_poker_websocket_event_duration_seconds` - WebSocket processing time
- `slam_poker_session_duration_seconds` - User session duration
- `slam_poker_voting_round_duration_seconds` - Voting round duration

### Node.js System Metrics (prefixed with `slam_poker_`)
- Process memory usage
- CPU utilization
- Event loop lag
- Garbage collection
- File descriptors

## Alert Rules

Consider setting up these Prometheus alert rules:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: slam-poker-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: SLAMPokerHighErrorRate
        expr: rate(slam_poker_errors_total[5m]) > 0.1
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"

      - alert: SLAMPokerHighLatency
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(slam_poker_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 0.5
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High response time detected"

      - alert: SLAMPokerServiceDown
        expr: up{job="slam-poker"} == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "SLAM Poker service is down"
```

## Dashboard Variables

Some dashboards support template variables for filtering:
- `$room_code` - Filter by specific room code
- `$interval` - Adjustable time interval for rate calculations
- `$percentile` - Select which percentile to display

## Customization

Each dashboard can be customized:
- **Thresholds**: Adjust warning/critical thresholds in panel settings
- **Time ranges**: Modify default time ranges
- **Refresh rates**: Adjust auto-refresh intervals
- **Panels**: Add/remove/modify panels based on your needs

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing
1. Verify Prometheus is scraping your application
2. Check that metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) is accessible
3. Ensure data source configuration in Grafana is correct

### High Cardinality Warnings
If you have many rooms, consider:
- Adding recording rules for high-cardinality metrics
- Using label aggregation in queries
- Setting up metric retention policies

### Performance Issues
- Use recording rules for complex queries
- Reduce query ranges for heavy dashboards
- Consider downsampling for historical data

## Support

These dashboards are designed specifically for the SLAM Poker application's metrics schema. Modify queries and panels as needed for your specific monitoring requirements.
